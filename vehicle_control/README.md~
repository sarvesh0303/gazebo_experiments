# gazebo_vehicle_control

Currently a minimal Gazebo simulation for a four wheeled vehicle with Ackermann steering. No ROS integration yet. Joints are directly PID-controlled using gazebo plugins.

This project is meant to be used as a template for simplistic simulations in gazebo, primarily for testing of motion planning and AI targeted simulations.

World File:
car2.world

Plugin:
push.cpp

Instructions to use:
Your work is cut out. Terminal in the folder
$ sh run.sh
Once gzserver starts running, start gzclient in another terminal window. And the simulation is ready to go.

Software Requirement:
Gazebo 7. ROS not required
